.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
.RI [ command_file ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a basic UNIX command line interpreter written in C.
It reads commands from standard input or from a file, parses them,
and executes them by searching for executables in the directories
listed in the PATH environment variable.

The shell supports both interactive and non-interactive modes,
built-in commands, and execution of external programs using
system calls such as fork, execve, and wait.

.SH INVOCATION
.B simple_shell
can be invoked in two different modes.

.SS Interactive Mode
When standard input is connected to a terminal, the shell runs in
interactive mode. A prompt is displayed, and the shell waits for
the user to type commands.

Example:
.PP
.nf
$ ./simple_shell
-_- \_(ツ)_/ $ ls
-_- \_(ツ)_/ $ exit
.fi

.SS Non-Interactive Mode
When standard input is not connected to a terminal, the shell reads
commands from standard input without displaying a prompt.

Example:
.PP
.nf
$ echo "ls -l" | ./simple_shell
.fi

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following built-in commands are implemented:

.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables.

.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell.

.TP
.B cd
Changes the current working directory.
(Current implementation is minimal.)

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
If the command entered is not a built-in, the shell searches for the
command in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
If the executable is found and has execute permission, it is executed
in a child process.

If the command cannot be found, an error message is printed and
the shell returns status 127.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The shell returns the exit status of the last executed command.
If an error occurs during execution, an appropriate non-zero
status is returned.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The shell uses the following environment variables:

.TP
.B PATH
Specifies the directories where executable programs are searched.

.SH ERRORS
If a command is not found, the shell prints an error message to
standard error in the following format:

.PP
.nf
program_name: line_number: command: not found
.fi

.SH FILES
None.

.SH LIMITATIONS
This shell does not support:
- Command chaining
- Pipes
- Redirections
- Wildcards
- Command history
